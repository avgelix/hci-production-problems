## ITMD 362, Production Problem 02: Color Palettes

For this production problem, you’re going to create several custom color palettes on the site
Paletton, http://paletton.com.

Before you start, be sure to read through the color theory readings on the course calendar for Week
Four.

Once you’ve read, you’ll choose a palette based on each prompt below, and paste the Paletton URL in
with your chosen palette (you’ll see that the `uid` value in the Paletton URL changes with each
adjustment that you make). Write a few sentences explaining why you chose the colors you did.

Opt for the Paletton Preview mode “Default with Text,” so you can see how text looks on each palette
you choose. Use the Preview tab at the bottom of the palette preview.

1. A **monochromatic color palette** for a site introducing a new console gaming platform

Your Palette URL: https://paletton.com/#uid=15d0u0kulrYf79G61NSiuzyqZ5n
Your Rationale: The color dark pink (my base hue), resonates with purple and warm colors, giving ooff a sense of passion and enthusiasm. I have used two shades and two tints in my palette, in order to create variance, in particular the first and last colors in my palette are very high and very low in value, creating a very neat contrast without resulting chaotic.

2. An **adjacent color palette** for announcing springtime tours at the Chicago Botanical Gardens

Your Palette URL: https://paletton.com/#uid=51T0+1knytW7OH54wfngh88q5hWkkhllu2+Y+Yz1YOCXiG++kkhllu2+Y+Yz1YOCXiG++
Your Rationale: My base hues are basically yellow, green and brown. I believe these three evoke three things about spring: the cheerfulness, the nature, and the earth. I have chosen to given them the same chroma, as the alpha value in their RGBA values show. This looks very aesthetically pleasing, sober yet cheerful, so fitting for the specified purpose.

3. A **triadic color palette** for styling the login page for an app for kids to learn the alphabet

Your Palette URL: https://paletton.com/#uid=32Q0Z1knxvAq9aOe0++00JQ++mzkp5F+nzdolY+X1+LD5FtNkp5F+q9aOi2++1Vz700iN
Your Rationale: My base hues are green, purple and orange. While the green and purple have higher values, I chose a darker shade of orange. The brightness of the blue and purple give that childish vibe, the orange probably allows for some relaxation given this website is supposed to be used for learning something --i.e. kids need to spend time without burning their eyes with very bright colors all over.

4. A **custom color palette** for advertising a course on cybersecurity

Your Palette URL:
https://paletton.com/#uid=c4C4m2j321k6E-BEvqk2ufr2ufrmTfAkmcCLVn1T2ufr2ufr2ufrk3AyfAf8W00oS00oS00oSkgdyYVn1T2ufr2ufr2ufr
Your Rationale: I chose a hue (purple)in its more pure form, and in a very high value form, a neutral hue (a tint of light green, very white-looking), and an accent hue (a tint of green). I believe the low saturation level of the entire palette gives a sense of relaxation along with authority, making the entire combination look cold. The contrast between the purple and the green fits well with the idea of technology, and the cool color choices follow the idea of "safety" embedded in the discipline of cybersecurity.
