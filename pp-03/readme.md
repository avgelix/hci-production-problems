## ITMD 362, Production Problem 03: Implementing HCI Guidelines for Touchscreens

## The Problem

You’ve read about HCI guideline’s throughout Josh Clark’s *Designing for Touch*. This Production
Problem is your opportunity to apply them to an existing form.

Using the HCI guidelines from either iOS or Android, sketch a new small-screen touch-friendly design
for the membership account-creation page for Chicago’s Museum of Contemporary Art at https://experience.mcachicago.org/account/create (Hint: visit the URL on your phone).

**You only need to sketch your redesign**, and in the text below, reference at least three different
points of guidance from chosen HCI guidelines that went into your redesign sketches (you might want to do multiple sketches, each highlighting a different feature of the same overall design).

## Resources

Choose from either Apple’s or Google’s design guidelines:

* Apple iOS HCI Guidlines:
  https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/ios/
* Google Material Design 3 Guidelines:
  https://m3.material.io

## Deliverables

Small commits to your Production Problems repository that include:

1. Photographs of sketches of your new design, from your sketchbook, or digital sketches
2. An explanation of three different points of guidance from your chosen guidelines (point to the
   specific URL where the guidance can be found) that you implemented in your sketch, written below:

* HCI Guideline One (URL):
  https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/ios/
  "User Control
  Throughout iOS, people—not apps—are in control. An app can suggest a course of action or warn about dangerous consequences, but it’s usually a mistake for the app to take over the decision-making. The best apps find the correct balance between enabling users and avoiding unwanted outcomes. An app can make people feel like they’re in control by keeping interactive elements familiar and predictable, confirming destructive actions, and making it easy to cancel operations, even when they’re already underway."

* Describe how you implemented that guideline in your sketch:
  The menu side bar is not entirely clickable, except for the actual "MENU" text in the far top left of the screen, which is far out of the thumb-zone. Since the bar is there, I would make it entirely clickable and distinguishable as specifically related to the menu, by inverting its colors (see sketch 1).




* HCI Guideline Two (URL):
  https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/ios/user-interaction/data-entry/

  "Require field values only when necessary. Use required fields only for information that is truly necessary to proceed."

* Describe how you implemented that guideline in your sketch:
  In the current version of the signing up, every section has a significant number of fields to complete, which in most cases could be collected into one or even just removed (see sketch 2).


* HCI Guideline Three (URL):
  https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/ios/visual-design/terminology/
  "Keep interface text clear and concise. People absorb short, direct text quickly and easily and don’t appreciate being forced to read long passages to accomplish a task. Identify the most important information, express it succinctly, and present it prominently so people don’t have to read too much to find what they’re looking for or figure out what to do next."

* Describe how you implemented that guideline in your sketch:
  The "required" label appears on every field, and shows up again below the input box for every field the very second the user clicks onto it. This is not only frustrating but redundant and avoidable. Other language used in this form is articulate and not very clear in guiding the user seamlessly through the sign up/log in processes.

  

For the Production Problem discussion next week, be sure to share your sketches and chosen
guidelines.
