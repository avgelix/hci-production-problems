## ITMD 362, Production Problem 05: Usability Checklists

Usability checklists are typical, and sometimes mindless, tools/magic tricks used to find usability
problems in web and other digital projects. What you are going to do for this Production Problem is
to locate at least 2 different usability checklists of at least 25 items (use Google, but challenge
yourself to go beyond the first page of results).

From those lists, create your own, condensed list of exactly ten items **that are relevant to your
teams’s interface from Project Two**.

Finally, I highly encourage you to work on this Production Problem with your team for Project
Two/Three to help yourselves create your own master usability checklist, and smooth the way forward
for your first (and second) round of usability testing.

## Deliverables

* URLs for the usability checklists you’ve found:

1.https://teamsuccess.io/UX
2.https://internetdevels.com/blog/50-point-checklist-for-website-usability-testing

* Your team’s condensed ten-item, must-have usability checklist:

1.Transparent pricing. Prices are clearly displayed. There are no hidden costs or surprises in the terms.

2.Clear call for action. Users know what to do next and why it benefits them. They understand the value proposition and purpose of the site.

3.Navigation is consistent on every page.

4.Simplicity. Only absolutely necessary questions are asked in forms.

5.Form submission is confirmed on e.g. a confirmation page.

6.Long dropdown menus are avoided. Instead users can input text, which is validated on the backend.

7.Color alone is not used to convey information.

8.By giving users some tips, you will reduce the number of mistakes. You may do it in several ways. Your tip can either be placed in the input field or be a part of the instructions to the question.

9.Minimize user input to gain more accurate data.

10.Language in all texts is simple enough for all users to understand.
