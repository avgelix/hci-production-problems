  <p>The original pairing from the <a href="https://www.typeconnection.com">typeconnection website</a>
    suggested that <em>Universe</em> (a sans-serif font from 1957) paired well with <em>Linotype centennial</em>
    (1986), a neoclassical serif released by Adobe in honor of the 100th birthday of the Linotype machine.</p>

    <p>In the same way, <em>Raleway</em> and <em>PT-Serif</em>, my chosen fonts, pair well because
        of the way their differences harmonize. The rigidity and simplicity of Raleway get along well
        with PT-Serif's rich history and elegance.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
    <p>Similarly to Linotype Centennial, the font PT Serif is a serif typeface with humanistic
        terminals. It was designed for use together with PT Sans, and is harmonized
        across metrics, proportions, weights and design.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
    <p>Raleway is a neo-grotesque sans-serif font, sharing these two properties with the font Universe.
        Additionally, Raleway is a display face and it features both old style and
        lining numerals, standard and discretionary ligatures, a pretty complete set of diacritics,
        as well as a stylistic alternate inspired by geometric sans-serif typefaces.</p>
